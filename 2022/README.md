# Advent Of Code 2022

Using a different language each Day!!

(For obvious reason some solutions might be absolute shitcode, since I'm learning
a lot of the languages on the fly without ever having used them before)

## Languages

- [x] c: Day 1
- [x] sql: Day 2
- [x] powershell (core): Day 3
- [x] bash: Day 4
- [x] perl: Day 5 (oh my god this is so unreadable)
- [x] nim: Day 6
- [x] go: Day 7
- [x] v: Day 8 (cool language but holy cow is the language server bad)
- [x] swift: Day 9 (wow this language is actually very nice good job apple)
